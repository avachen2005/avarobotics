# Specification Quality Checklist: iOS Design Tokens

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. The spec references Swift/SwiftUI in metadata context (as the target platform per user input) but does not prescribe implementation patterns, which is appropriate for a design token specification.
- The spec intentionally includes specific hex values and point sizes because these ARE the requirements (the "what"), not implementation details (the "how").
- Typography mentions SF Pro Display/SF Pro Text — these are platform-native fonts and part of the design requirement, not an implementation choice.
